#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 1

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, I convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, I took a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.

What you find here:

1. filter some resturants according to some features,
2. the review of each restaurants,
3. the work schedule in the restaurant weekly,
4. the address of the resturants.

In this project I was use:

1. Service-Worker to make the website work offline,
2. aria roles to get the website accessabile for blind people,
3. google maps app to mark all restaurants on it.

Sounds good!? 

Let me tell you how to install:

1. Clone this respository,
2. Open the root folder with app,
3. Then run 'npm install' on your Terminal,
4. Now 'python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000' (for Python 2.X version),
5. Open your browser 'http://localhost:8000'.

Feel free to contact if you have some advices:)
